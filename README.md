Video Tracker API - Framework Comparison
This repository contains implementations of the same Video Tracker API built with three different Python web frameworks:

Flask with OpenAPI
Django with Django REST Framework
FastAPI

Each implementation provides identical functionality while showcasing the unique patterns and benefits of each framework.
Core Functionality
All implementations provide a RESTful API for tracking videos with the following features:

Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for video entries
CSV-based data storage for simplicity (no database required)
Sorting by name, post date, or view count
Input validation
API documentation
Proper error handling

Comparing the Frameworks
Flask with OpenAPI
Pros:

Lightweight and minimal
Explicit routing
Flexible structure
OpenAPI integration for API documentation

Characteristics:

Manual handling of request data
Function-based views
Manual serialization/deserialization with Pydantic

Django with REST Framework
Pros:

Rich ecosystem
ViewSet-based API organization
Built-in admin interface potential
Class-based views

Characteristics:

Serializer classes for data validation
Router-based URL configuration
ViewSet pattern for CRUD operations

FastAPI
Pros:

Built-in OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI)
Automatic request/response validation
High performance
Concise code

Characteristics:

Path and query parameter type validation
Dependency injection
Type hints for validation
Asynchronous support

Implementation Notes

Each implementation uses the same CSV file format
The API endpoints are nearly identical across implementations
Error handling follows the same patterns in all implementations
